# Welcome to your GPT Engineer project

## Project info

**Project**: sneaker-wallet-tracker 

**URL**: https://run.gptengineer.app/projects/0384868f-a709-4796-b16e-2240b01fe5bf/improve

**Description**: Create an accounting single page app to track my sneaker side-hustle. It should support: 

• Adding a new transaction with details such as date, amount, type (income/expense), and category (dropdown with e.g. sneaker brand)
• View a list of my sneaker purchases, showing details like date, amount, type, and brand
• Edit an existing sneaker purchase in case I made an error or an update is needed
• Delete a sneaker purchase if it was added by mistake or is no longer relevant

Feel free to add some placeholder transactions.

## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

We don't support custom domains (yet). If you want to deploy your project under your own domain, then we recommend GitHub Pages.
